        Hello!
        <br />
        Iâ€™m a passionate full-stack web developer with a diverse background that
        bridges technical support at Apple Care, language interpretation, and
        database administration. With over two years immersed in the tech
        sector, my expertise spans the MERN stack, Next.js, TailwindCSS, SCSS,
        and PostgreSQL. My toolbox also includes the latest technologies like
        the ShadCN component library, TypeScript, and dynamic animations using
        FramerMotion.

      <br />
      <p>
        My journey into web development was kick-started with a rigorous
        six-month training in computer sciences from Izmir School of Economics,
        which paved the way for my deep dive into coding and software
        development. Throughout my career, I have faced challenging projects and
        complex team dynamics. These experiences have not only honed my
        technical skills but have also instilled a resilience and commitment to
        integrity and respect in the workplace.
      </p>

      <br />
      <p>
        I believe in continuous learning and adaptability as the cornerstones of
        both personal and professional growth. I am committed to leveraging my
        comprehensive technical knowledge and problem-solving skills in an
        environment that values respect and human decency as much as I do.
        Looking forward to building transformative solutions with equally
        remarkable people.
